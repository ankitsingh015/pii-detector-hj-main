# Deployment Strategy for Real-Time PII Defense

## Recommended Architecture

Given Flixkart’s architecture (see ![image1](image1)), the optimal, scalable, and low-latency deployment for the PII Detector & Redactor is as follows:

### **1. API Gateway or Ingress Plugin (Preferred)**
- **What:** Deploy the redactor as a plugin or sidecar at the API Gateway/Ingress layer (e.g., Kong, NGINX, Envoy, or Express middleware).
- **Why:**  
  - **Scalability:** Handles all inbound/outbound API traffic centrally, requiring no changes to microservices.
  - **Latency:** Fast in-memory redaction using regex/NER adds minimal latency.
  - **Coverage:** Catches PII leaks from all backend services, including those not under direct control.
  - **Cost:** Avoids per-microservice deployment and leverages existing gateway infra.
- **How:**  
  - Integrate the Python redactor as a REST microservice or WASM/native plugin.
  - All JSON payloads passing through the gateway are checked and redacted in real time.
  - Logs are sanitized before leaving the trust boundary.

### **2. Backend Middleware (Node.js/Express)**
- **Alternative:** Drop-in as Express middleware within the MCP/Backend server.
- **Why:**  
  - **Ease of integration:** No network hop, sits directly in the request pipeline.
  - **Configurable:** Can be enabled per-route or per-user.
  - **Limitation:** Won’t cover logs or assets handled outside Express.

### **3. Log Pipeline Sanitizer (Supplemental)**
- **What:** Attach the redactor to log forwarding/collection agents (Fluentd, Logstash, ELK).
- **Why:**  
  - Prevents accidental PII in logs reaching external systems or SIEM.
  - Good for defense-in-depth and retroactive scrubbing.

## Example Integration (API Gateway, Pseudocode)
```python
# Express.js example using Python via REST
@app.before_request
def sanitize_payload():
    payload = request.get_json()
    redacted, is_pii = call_python_redactor(payload)
    # Replace request data with redacted version before further processing
```
Or as a Kong/Envoy plugin (Lua, WASM, or native).

## Security Controls & Monitoring
- PII detection logs can be streamed to the Dashboard (see architecture).
- Policy management exposed to Admin Panel for tuning redaction, exceptions, or audit.

## Rollout Plan
- Start with Gateway/Ingress to maximize coverage with zero business logic refactoring.
- Supplement with backend middleware for critical in-app flows.
- Periodically audit logs for PII using the same redactor as a validation tool.

## Conclusion
This deployment minimizes engineering effort, delivers rapid risk reduction, and fits Flixkart’s cloud-native, API-centric stack. The approach is scalable, cost-effective, and easy to maintain or extend (e.g., new PII types, improved NER).
